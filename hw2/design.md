World Trade Cargo & Logistics Planning

This visualization is designed to help world trade companies plan for the future. By selecting a key country and using the year slider, they can see trends from the top 10 export countries. This helps each sales team team focus specific countries in their territory/region.

4 quadrants are used in the visualization:

1. High Export / Low Margin (Gray)
2. High Export / High Margin (Dark Gray)
3. Low Export / Low Margin (Light Gray)
4. Low Export / High Margin (Gray)

The sales team would be interested in knowing about countries that are in or trending into the top right quadrant(2). The top right quadrant represents high exports and high GDP per capita. By focusing their efforts on these countries, their time may result in higher sales and with higher margins. We don't want them to focusing on countries in or trending into quadrant (3).

Colors are used to show what continents each export country is from. This helps group countries together by continent, see outliers and visually understand how far an export country is from the Key Country.
